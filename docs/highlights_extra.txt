* Additional highlights that need to go into confluence page at some point:

- Nvidia Drive PX2 and what it does: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URmxzxYlmtg
- supervised classification algorithms - naive bayes, support vector machines, decision trees
- entropy and information gain
- bias-variance dilemma
- HoG paper
- Creating feature vectors with HoG
- Multiscale HoG windows
- heat maps to combine multiple detections
- Others have used SSD classifier instead for faster detection (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)
