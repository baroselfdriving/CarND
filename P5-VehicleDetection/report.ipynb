    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "The objective is to develop a software pipeline to identify and track vehicles in a video stream obtained from a front-facing camera mounted on the dashboard of a car. A linear support vector machine (SVM) is trained to identify vehicles based on histogram-of-oriented-gradients (HOG) features extracted from 'car' and 'non-car' image sets. The trained SVM is then applied on the video stream to search and identify vehicles. The robustness of the identification pipeline is improved by temporal filtering techniques to discard false positives. \n",
